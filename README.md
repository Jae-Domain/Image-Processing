# SRCA-Comic Research
 In participation with SRCA REU program Summer 2021

Faculty Advisor: Dr. Arnav Jhala

Our project aims to determine how human cognition and stimuli are affected by changing color and saturation in comics. To aid this research, we have constructed the "Anti-Colorization" program to prototype images that have had their color removed or altered. 

Line Art
Generates the lineart of an image by removing all colors that are above a specified brightness.
